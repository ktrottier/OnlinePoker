===========

The game as it was, was missing all pictures and had everything justified to the top left of the page.  There was no styling whatsover.

By adding an entire CSS file:

Made up the interface again by adding all appropriate pictures to the missing areas.

Added grid alignment and centered the game. resized the images and added hover features to image buttons.

Added a border and created custom borders for the Score and Hand sections.

*After typing up the entire game, it just didn't function.  Due to time contstraints, the page only received improved stylizing.  Would still like to fix more.
